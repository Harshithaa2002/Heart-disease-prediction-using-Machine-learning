# Heart-disease-prediction-using-Machine-learning

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating efficient methods for early detection and diagnosis. This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using a range of machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project includes various medical features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate achieved, among others. A combination of data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, outlier detection, feature scaling, and feature selection, was employed to prepare the dataset for modeling. Ten different machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and more, were evaluated through cross-validation to identify the best-performing models.
